# 🔢 Ladder Scaling Method for Custom Pod Autoscaler (CPA)

## 📖 Overview
This configuration demonstrates how to set up a Custom Pod Autoscaler (CPA) in ladder mode to dynamically scale a Kubernetes deployment based on cluster resources (CPU cores or nodes). The ladder method provides step-based scaling, which can be more efficient than linear scaling for certain workloads.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Apply all configuration files
kubectl apply -f .
```

## 🏗️ How Ladder Scaling Works

Ladder scaling defines specific scaling thresholds and corresponding replica counts, creating "steps" in your scaling behavior. This is particularly useful when:

- You want predictable scaling patterns
- Your application has specific scaling requirements at different load levels
- You need to maintain minimum performance levels at specific thresholds

### Key Benefits:
- Precise control over scaling behavior
- Predictable performance characteristics
- Prevents rapid scaling fluctuations
- Better resource utilization in specific load ranges

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Key Parameters in ConfigMap:

```yaml
ladder:
  # Define your scaling thresholds and replica counts
  steps:
    - threshold: 1
      replicas: 2
    - threshold: 20
      replicas: 4
    - threshold: 50
      replicas: 8
    - threshold: 100
      replicas: 16
```

## 🧪 Example Scenario

### Cluster Specifications:
- **Schedulable Nodes**: 12
- **Total CPU Cores**: 34
- **Current Load**: 45% CPU utilization

### Expected Behavior:
- For the example configuration above, at 45% CPU utilization:
  - The autoscaler would maintain 8 replicas (as it falls between the 20-50% threshold)

## 🛡️ High Availability

### Prevent Single Point of Failure
- **`preventSinglePointFailure: true`** (if configured) ensures:
  - Pods are distributed across different nodes
  - Prevents multiple pods from being scheduled on the same node
  - Enhances reliability by reducing impact of node failures

## 📊 Monitoring and Verification

```bash
# Check current replicas and their distribution
kubectl get pods -o wide -n <namespace>

# View autoscaler logs
kubectl logs -f <autoscaler-pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Monitor resource utilization
kubectl top pods -n <namespace>
```

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Review and customize the `0-configmap.yaml` for your specific requirements
2. Deploy the application and autoscaler
3. Monitor the scaling behavior under different load conditions
4. Adjust the ladder steps based on your application's performance characteristics
